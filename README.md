# Routing-Services
This is a navigational project of my college Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIT) which calculates shortest path between various loations of SIT using Dijkstra Algorithm.
So basically just like **Google maps**,the user selects one of the source location from available locations of Symbiosis Institute and recieves a small desciption of source location.
Then he/she will enter a destination location and again recieve a small description.
The **Dijkstra algorithm** will calculate smalles distance and path from source to destination and return the same to user.
